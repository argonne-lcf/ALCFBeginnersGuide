The decals are stickers attached to the front of the computer _racks_ (closet sized). If you look inside a single closet you will see rows of computer _nodes_. Notice that there are repetitive rows inside the racks. These machines are made for _nodes_ to be replaced if needed.

Inside ThetaGPU, you'll also see repetition, though NVidia placed these fancy plates over the hardware so you only see their logo. However, each plate covers 1 computer _node_.
