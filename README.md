# ALCF Beginners Guide

If you are new to using supercomputers and/or ALCF systems, this is the starting place for you. This guide will teach you the following:
* how to login to ALCF systems
* how to setup a usable environment on a login node
* how to query the job scheduler
* how to submit an interactive job to execute examples on a worker node
* how to submit a job script to the scheduler

We have versions of these steps laid out for each of our systems so please pick the system you wish to begin with and start there:
